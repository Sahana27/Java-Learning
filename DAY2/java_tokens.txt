Java Tokens
==>Smallest indiviual unit in a program is known as tokens
==>Compiler recognizes them to build up expression and statements
==>Java is collection of tokens , comments and white spaces

Five types of tokens in Java are:
=>Reserve keywords
=>Identifiers
=>Literals
=>Operators 
=>Separator

Character Set:
==>Smallest unit of Java
==>defines using unicode set 

Keyword:
==>Keywords combined along with operators according to the syntax form Java Definition.
==>Keywords cannot be used as names of variable,classes and method
==>keywords are in lower case
==>Java is case sensitive
==>REMEMEBER never use null, true or false as name of file or variable in Java program.

Identifiers:
==>Program defines tokens
==>Used for naming classes,method , variables,object,label,package and interface.
==>Identifiers follow following rules:
	=>Can have alphabet,dollar,underscore and digit
	=>Must not begin with digit
	=>upper and lowercase are distinct
	=>they can be of any length
==> Identifier must be short so that they can be easily typed and long enough for understanding.
==>ALl public method and instance variable start with leading letter which is lower case.
   average 
   sum
==>More than one word is used in the identifier.First word starting letter is small and second word Starting letter is in caps
	dayTemperature
	firstDayOfMonth
	totalMarks
==>private and local variable use only lowercase along with underscore	
   length
   batch_strength
==>Classes and Interface begin with leading uppercase letter
==>COnstant variable are all in uppercase  and underscore between words
   TOTAL
   X_MAX

Literals
==>Sequence of character that represent constant value to be stored in variable
==>Five major types of Literals
	=>Integer Literal
	=>Floating point literal
	=>Character literal
	=>String Literal
	=>boolean Literal

Operator:
==>Operator symbol that take one or two operand and operates on them to produce result.

Separator:
==>Separator are symbols used to define where groups of code are divided and arranged.

Command Line Arguments
==>Providing input at time of execution.Java provides command line argument
==>Look at the the main syntax
 public static void main (String args[])
 args is declared as array of String
 Any parameter passed through command line is stored in args array.
 Which can be simply used in the program.
 
Java Programming Style:
==>FreeForm Language
==>Indentation is required only for more readability by user. Not by the compiler.

CONSTANTS
==>Refer to value that does not change during the execution of the program
Java Constants has two Parts Numeric and Character Constants
Numeric Constants: Integer and Real COnstants
Character Constants :Character and String Constants
INTEGER CONSTANTS:
==> Sequence of digit
==> Three types of Integer:
	=>decimal Integer
	=>Octal Integer
	=>Hexadecimal Integer

Decimal Integer:
=>Set of 0 through 9
=>Optional minus.

Octal Integer:
==> Set of number from 0 to 7 precedded by 0.

Hexadecimal Integer:
==>Preceded by 0x or 0X.
==>Include alphabet from A to F

REAL Constatnt
==>fraction number are called real constants
==>Shown in decimal form
==>Floating point numbers

Single Character Constant:
==>Single character which is put inside an single paranthesis.

String Constant:
==> Sequence of character placed inside a double quotes.

Backslash Character constant:
==>They have two character.
==> These are called escape sequence

Variables:
==>storage location used to store a data value.
==>variable will different values different time  during different execution
==>variable name consists of alphabet,digit,dollar,underscore
==>Rules of variable naming:
	=>should not begin with digit
	=>uppercase and lowercase are different
	=>should not be a keyword
	=>whitespace is not allowed
	=>variable names can be any of length.
DECLARATION OF VARIABLE:
==>It does three things:
	Tells compiler what variable name is
	Specifies what type of data the variable are hold
	Place the declaration decides the scope of the variable.
==> declare variable before it is used.
==> SYntax:
	datatype variable1,variable2,... variablen;
variables are separated by comma and ends with semicolon

Giving values to variable:
==>Can be achieved by:
	Assignment statement 
	read statement

Scope of Variables:
Classified into three types:
instance variable 
class variable 
local variable

Instance  Variable:
==> Found inside the class
==>Variables are created when the class is instantiated

Class variable:
==> found inside the class=>
==>not available for use outside the method
==> creayed when method is created and destroyed when method is terminated.
==>
Local variable:
==>Created inside method

	
Assignment Statement:
Syntax :
		variable_name=value;
		  or
	Assign value at time of declaration
	  type variable_name= value

Read Statement 
	=> Assign value to variable interactively through keyboard.
	=> Thix will be explained in later part.

Getting Values Of A Variable:
==>Printing the variable using print or println
==>print()-print and wait
==>println()prints and moves to the new line	
	
DATA TYPES:
==>Each variable has a data typed
==>Data type specify the size and type of values that can be stored.
==>Data types in Java are divided
   Primitive data type:
		Numeric :Integer and FLoating Point
		Non Numeric :Character and Boolean
	Non Primitive Data Type
		Classes
		Interface
		Array

Integer Types:
==> Four types of Integer Type:
	byte-one byte
	short -two byte
	int - four byte
	long - eight byte

Floating Point Types
==>Holds decimal number
==>float are single precession  and double are double precision
==> float is four byte and double is eight byte

Character Type:
==>Char type- 2 byte

Boolean Type:
==> true or false.

TYPE CASTING
==>Situation where we need to store output of one type variable into another type variable
==>Syntax:
    type variable1=(type)variable2

Default values for different variable type:
