Java first Program and Program Structure

class SampleOne {
	public static void main (String args []) {
		System.out.println("Java is better than C++ ");
	}
}

Class Declaration :
Class is object oriented COnstruct
Everything must be placed inside class
class-keyword
SampleOne is identifier 

Opening Braces : 
Class definition begins with  : open braces

main : method does not return any value.

Output Line
System.out.println("Java is better than C++ ");

Link printf, cout  this writes to standard output.

Program Structure

Documentation Section:
Set of COmment Line : name, program descripion etc.
Here in this part we explain why and what classes and how of algorithm
/** ....*/

Package Statement
Java file is a package statement
package name and informs compiler class defines package
Optional
syntax of package
 package <package_name>;

Import statement
Similiar to include
Instructs interpreter to load the class mentioned
import <clas_name>

Class Definitions:
Primary and Essential element of Java
Number of classes depends on complexity

Main Method CLass:
starting point of program execution
Main class creates object of different class and establish communication between them
